My code reads data from a tree-ring CSV data set and prints the head of the file.
When run, the program prompts the user to enter the full path and name of the csv 
file to be processed.


The program can also process data from the file to print out the following 
summary statistics: 

- the first year that data is recorded for a series
- the last year that data is recorded for a series
- the length of the series in years
- the mean of series data
- the median of series data

A prompt is displayed that will ask the user if they wish to see these statistics.
If the user inputs "yes", then they will be shown
If the user inputs "no", nothing will happen and the program ends

The program's output format was modeled around examples from the dplR workshop which 
can be found here: https://opendendro.github.io/dplR-workshop/using-dplr.html
